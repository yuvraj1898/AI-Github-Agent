* The code could benefit from more comments and docstrings to explain what each function does and how it works.

**8. Design Patterns:**
The code does not appear to use any specific design patterns, such as MVC or Singleton. However, the use of functions and modules to organize the code is a good practice.

**9. Code Issues:**
Some potential code issues include:
* The `app.py` file is quite long and could be broken down into smaller files.
* There are no error handlers in place to handle potential errors, such as API request failures or file upload issues.
* The code does not include any logging or monitoring to track usage or performance.

**10. Strengths:**
The notable strengths of this codebase are:
* The application provides a useful and functional service for summarizing content.
* The code is well-organized and easy to follow.
* The use of Streamlit and other libraries makes it easy to build and deploy the application.

**11. Improvement Opportunities:**
Some areas for improvement include:
* Adding tests to ensure the code is working correctly.
* Breaking down long functions into smaller, more manageable functions.
* Adding error handlers to handle potential errors.
* Including logging and monitoring to track usage and performance.
* Considering scalability and performance issues, such as handling large files or high traffic.

**12. Recommendations:**
Some specific, actionable recommendations for enhancing the codebase include:
* Refactor the `app.py` file to break down long functions into smaller functions.
* Add tests using a testing framework such as Pytest or Unittest.
* Implement error handlers to handle potential errors, such as API request failures or file upload issues.
* Add logging and monitoring using a library such as Loguru or Prometheus.
* Consider using a more scalable and performant architecture, such as a microservices architecture or a cloud-based platform.
