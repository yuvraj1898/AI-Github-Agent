* `RepositoryList` (src/components/RepositoryList.tsx): This component displays a list of connected GitHub repositories.

**4. Output:**
The output of this repository is a web-based application that provides a conversational interface for users to interact with GitHub repositories. The application displays repository data and AI agent responses in a user-friendly format.

**5. User Interface:**
The user interface of this application is a web-based conversational interface. The flow of the application can be described as follows:
1. The user navigates to the application and is presented with a conversational interface.
2. The user prompts the AI agent to perform an action on a GitHub repository.
3. The AI agent processes the prompt and performs the requested action on the repository.
4. The application displays the repository data and AI agent responses.
5. The user can continue to interact with the AI agent to perform additional actions on the repository.

Here is a high-level diagram of the application flow:
```mermaid
