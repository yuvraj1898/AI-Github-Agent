Overall, the code quality is moderate, with some areas for improvement.

### 8. Design Patterns
The use of design patterns in this application is limited. However, some patterns that can be identified include:
- Component-based architecture: The application uses a component-based architecture, where each component represents a self-contained piece of functionality.
- Separation of Concerns: The application separates concerns by using different components for different functionality (e.g., navbar, feed, video details).

To improve the use of design patterns, the following suggestions can be made:
- Use a more modular approach: Break down the application into smaller, more modular components that can be easily reused and maintained.
- Use a state management pattern: Use a state management pattern such as Redux or MobX to manage global state and reduce complexity.

### 9. Code Issues
Based on the provided information, some potential code issues that can be identified include:
- Limited use of functions: The application only has one function, which may indicate that the code is not modular or reusable.
- High number of dependencies: The application has a large number of dependencies, which can make it difficult to manage and maintain.
- Limited error handling: The application may not have robust error handling mechanisms in place, which can make it difficult to debug and troubleshoot issues.

To address these issues, the following suggestions can be made:
- Refactor the code to use more functions and modular components.
- Review and optimize dependencies to reduce the number of dependencies and improve maintainability.
- Implement robust error handling mechanisms to improve debugging and troubleshooting.

### 10. Strengths
Some notable strengths of this codebase include:
- User-friendly interface: The application provides a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and use.
- Component-based architecture: The application uses a component-based architecture, which makes it easy to maintain and update individual components.
